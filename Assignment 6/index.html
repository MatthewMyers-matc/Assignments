        Welcome to the chat for lonely people. Here, you can pretend to have a chat with someone important
        by chatting with yourself! :D This is very simple, just type something in the box, hit send, then change your personality enough
        so that you can type something in the box again and hit reply to make it feel like you're talking to someone else.

        Just remember, this is a chat for lonely people to give them someone to talk to. Enjoy.
