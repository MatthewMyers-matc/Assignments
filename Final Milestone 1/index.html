    <h1>What will the website do?</h1>
    <p>My website is going to be more personal then others might be. My website goal is to make a tech portfolio website for myself.
    The idea behind this is that this will be a multi-paragraph or multi-page website made to look like a tech portfolio. It will include
  information about me, what i do as a programmer, samples of my past work, and of course ways to get in-touch with me. All done in a professional format.</p>

    <p>The idea behind this was I was starting to think of my future and what I wanted potental busness cliants to see. And while i could stick to a normal
    cover letter and resume, I figured why not put my HTML skills to use and make an entire website about myself and my work for future business opertunities</p>

    <h1>Target Audience</h1>
    <p>The target audience is as stated above, any future business opertunities that i may have. I can just send this website over and ask them to look it over.</p>

    <h1>User requirements</h1>
    <p>A user can basically look it over and decide if they wish to interview me more or hire me. The website will be a basic design with little visuals (as most of my work i dont own anymore),
      but the website will be effective none the less. So basically just to look over </p>
